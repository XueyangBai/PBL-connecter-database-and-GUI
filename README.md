#This GUI provides users with accurate predictions of the shear bearing capacity of PBL connectors. Users can simply input the required parameters as prompted on the interface or obtain parameters from the database by clicking the "Random Parameters" button to receive the shear bearing capacity prediction. Notably, the output provides two predictions: the first is the prediction from the ML model, and the second is the prediction based on the formula proposed in the paper, allowing users to refer to either depending on their needs.

On the right side of this project's GitHub page, find the **"Releases"** section. Click to enter and download the `.exe` file of the GUI tool. Simply double-click the file to open and view the application.(Win10)

In addition, this paper provides the original GUI code in both `.ipynb` and `.py` formats. You can run the program independently if the files are complete and properly located.
