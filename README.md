#This GUI provides users with accurate predictions of the shear bearing capacity of PBL connectors. Users can simply input the required parameters as prompted on the interface or obtain parameters from the database by clicking the "Random Parameters" button to receive the shear bearing capacity prediction. Notably, the output provides two predictions: the first is the prediction from the ML model, and the second is the prediction based on the formula proposed in the paper, allowing users to refer to either depending on their needs. Additionally, the GUI offers access to the complete database used to train the model.

The release includes the compiled .exe version of the GUI tool developed for predicting the shear capacity (Vu) of PBL connectors using a trained CatBoost model and an empirical formula.

Both .ipynb and .py formats of the code are provided for user convenience.
